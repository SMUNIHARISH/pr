			                <p>From the time the designer took up the site review to the delivery of the project, the journey was really smooth, Though there were a lot of changes during the design process, everything was catered to as we wished, without a single wrinkle on our face, to the extent that even after 6 months of handling over the projec to us, if there are any further requirements, there is always someone the next day itself to cater to it. For the time constraint thet they had, they did a tremendous work should say</p>
